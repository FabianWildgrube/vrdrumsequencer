## Running the server
Run the `pfsvrServer.py` script. This will start a Websocket Server listening on `localhost:9876`
(this can be changed through the `_IP` and `_PORT` variables in the script)

The server will generate a sound upon receiving a message with a JSON-object of the schema:
```JSON
{
    "id": "...",
    "Items": ["...100 float values..."]
}
```

The generated sound is returned to the requesting client as an uncompressed WAV (an array of float values with a frequency of 16000 samples/s).
